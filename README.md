## üß† Philosophy
<div align="center">

I don't get attached to code.

Every line should be easy to delete later because old code becomes dead weight.

I'd rather write more code with clear intent than less code with clever tricks.

Planning, readability, and documentation are how I show empathy for the next developer, even if that developer is me.

## üîß How I Work
<div align="center">
  
**üßΩ I like messy codebases**  
Cleaning them feels like stewardship: a quiet, fulfilling act of care for whoever comes next.

**ü™ö "Measure twice, cut once."**  
Planning prevents wasted effort.

**‚úçÔ∏è I write documentation**  
Early and often to scale knowledge.

**üî§ Readable code > clever code**  
Code should be easy to scan, with clear connections to where it runs. If it's confusing then it's not done.

**ü§ñ I use AI as a co-creator**  
To move faster from idea to prototype.

**üì¥ I unplug often**  
I think better when I step away from the screen.
