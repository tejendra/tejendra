## üß† Philosophy
<div align="left">
  
Code is a visitor.
It enters, serves, and must someday leave.
I write it clearly, so its purpose is known ‚Äî even when I am gone.

I do not chase cleverness.
I chase understanding.

Messy code is not a burden.
It is a garden ‚Äî overgrown, waiting to be tended.
I prune, not to impress, but to leave it lighter for the next hands.

I plan like a carpenter:
Measure twice, cut once.
The blueprint matters more than the hammer.

Documentation is not extra.
It is the echo of thought ‚Äî
a quiet guide for those who follow.

I use tools with intention.
Frameworks change. Clarity endures.

When the screen turns off, the mind stays on.
I think better when I step away from the code.

**Disclaimer**: This philosophy was written with help from AI because it helps me express what I already feel more clearly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

<div align="center">
  <p>I‚Äôm quick to learn tools, systems, or skills the work demands. I don‚Äôt cling to specific tools. I use whatever stack the problem calls for because flexibility is a technical skill.</p>
